AOP = Aspect Orientated Programming

example of Aspect (cross-cutting functionality for an application)
-logging
-exception handling
-security
-transactions
-caching
-legacy application modifications

Key Terms:
Learning:
    [Advice] = aspect applied at a JoinPoint
        [BeforeAdvice]: action executed BEFORE the target method
        [AroundAdvice]: action at the execution of the target method:
        [AfterAdvice]:  action executed AFTER the target method
        [AfterReturning]: post joinpoint execution
        [AfterThrowing]: post thrown exception
        [ChainOfAdvices]: list of
    ...
    [JoinPoint]: the method where aspect will be applied
    ....
    [PointCut]: predicate that matches join points
    ...
    [Target Object]: object being adviced by 1 or more aspects
    [runtime AOP proxy] a wrapper around the target object that introduces additional
                    methods or attributes to the target object
    [Introduction]: additional methods or attributes added by the Aspect runtime proxy
                    to a target object.
    [Weaving]: Transformation applied by Aspects to the Target Object to create the Advice
                Weaving is done during run time(For Spring)

Spring AOP:
    Spring AOP implements Aspect proxy objects in two ways, depending on the inheritance/interface hierarchy
    of the Target Object:

    for Creating a Aspect Proxy object that extends aspect functionality  to the target object:
    1. If the Target Object implements an interface:
        Learning: use [JDK dynamic proxy standard mechanism]
            Spring will create a Aspect Proxy object by implement the same interface.

    2. If the Target Object DOES NOT implement an interface
        Learning: use [CGLIB Proxy mechanism]
            Spring  create a Aspect Proxy object by inheriting/extends from the Target Object
             if the Target Object is tagged as "final", then this method will not work and you can not create aspect
